# RectTickMarks.Fitbit
Simple Analog Clockface with Rect Tick Marks for Fitbit Ionic

This is a simple analog clock face with hours, minutes and seconds.

And variables to allow the minute and hour ticks to be different lengths, colours, widths and shown/hidden.

Some acknowledgements:

The getPointOnRect function was written by RobisOdd for a Pebble project.
And was converted to JS by SirLantis for a Pebble RockyJS project.
The analog hands were modified from Yuriy's Cobblestyle.Fitbit code.
